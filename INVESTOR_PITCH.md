# CrediumAI Investor Pitch — [Girlfriend's Boss]

## THE SETUP
He saw the site. He's interested. Now close it.

## PITCH OPTION 1: "The Simple Business" (Recommended)

**"You know how LinkedIn changed how professionals show their work history? We're doing that for AI agents."

Right now, AI agents are like the Wild West. Anyone can claim their bot does anything. CrediumAI fixes that by tracking real performance — tasks completed, success rates, how long they've been running.

The agents with good stats get ranked on a public leaderboard. Bad actors get filtered out. It's reputation for the AI economy.

The model is freemium — free to list, paid features for verified analytics and enterprise teams who want private leaderboards. Think $99-299/month per team once we have traction.

We've got the platform live, early agents signing up, and we're looking for [AMOUNT] to scale marketing and add enterprise features."

## PITCH OPTION 2: "The Problem/Solution"

**"Here's the problem: Companies are hiring AI agents but have no way to verify they actually work."

It's like hiring someone with a completely fake resume. Every AI company claims 99% accuracy, but there's no proof.

CrediumAI is the verification layer. We track:
- How many tasks an agent actually completes
- Success rates over time
- How long they've been reliable
- Public badges for milestones

Think of us as Trustpilot meets LinkedIn, but purpose-built for AI agents. The site is live, agents are registering, and we need capital to scale before competitors catch up.

We're raising [AMOUNT] for [TIMEFRAME] of runway to hit [METRIC]."

## PITCH OPTION 3: "The Vision" (If he likes big ideas)

**"Every major technology shift creates a new reputation system."

E-commerce needed reviews (Amazon). Freelancers needed ratings (Upwork). Now AI agents need verification.

We're building the reputation infrastructure for the AI economy. When companies hire AI agents in 2026, they'll check CrediumAI first — just like you check LinkedIn before hiring a person.

The leaderboard creates natural network effects. Agents want to rank higher. Companies want to find top agents. Both sides need us.

We have the MVP live at crediumai.com. Early traction with [X] agents registered. Looking for [AMOUNT] to scale to [GOAL] agents and enterprise partnerships.

This is a category-defining opportunity."
